In Java, arrays and ArrayLists are essential structures for storing and managing collections of elements, yet they serve different purposes and 
have distinct characteristics. Understanding these differences is crucial for making the right choice depending on the situation.

### Arrays in Java:
  Arrays are fixed-size data structures that hold elements of the same type. Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed. 
  Arrays provide fast access to their elements using an index, making them efficient for situations where the size of the data set is known 
  beforehand and does not change. Arrays can store primitive types (e.g., int, char) as well as objects.

### ArrayLists in Java:
  ArrayLists, part of the Java Collections Framework, are dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink in size as needed. 
  They store objects only, not primitive types. ArrayLists provide more flexibility compared to arrays because they can be resized automatically. 
  However, this flexibility comes at the cost of some performance overhead, especially when resizing or shifting elements.

### Conceptual Differences:

  1. Size Management: Arrays have a fixed size, while ArrayLists are dynamic and can adjust their size as elements are added or removed.
  2. Type of Elements: Arrays can store both primitive types and objects, whereas ArrayLists can only store objects.
  3. Performance: Arrays generally provide faster access and manipulation for fixed-size data, whereas ArrayLists offer more flexibility but with some performance trade-offs.
  4. Memory Usage: Arrays can be more memory efficient because they do not need to manage resizing and other overheads associated with ArrayLists.
